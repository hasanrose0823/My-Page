                <h3>Khamarpara primary school</h3>
                <h5>2006-2010</h5>
                <p>I started school in 2005. In 2006, I was admitted to the class One. 
                   Then my roll number was 20. There were many friends. Every day I would go to school earlier, to sit at the first table. 
                   It was a very good time. Seeing this passes class 1,2,3,4 went away. After getting up to the fifth class, I heard that 
                   we have to give a difficult final exam, which is called the PEC. If I fail in it, I will not be able to get admission 
                   in high school.Can I be scared at first? We were all asked to submit two passport size photos with 200 tk. That day
                   we all went to take Photos in studio. Just a few days before the exam, the elder brother and sisters are giving great
                   knowledge. How to make the exam better. Giving the first public test of life was a little scary. But after going to
                   the test center, all the fears disappeared.A boy was sitting next to me, Riyadh. Finally the test is over. I did well
                   in the result. But it is very surprising that my friend behind me got the scholarship. This is how the Primary school 
                   life ended.Not to mention some good teachers.Those are Salauddin Sir, Shahajan Sir, Delwar Sir, Laila Mam, Leah Mam,
                   Monowara Mam.
                </p>
                <h3>Kachiara high school</h3>
                <h5>2011-2016</h5>
                <p>
                   I was admitted to the high school through the admission test in 2011. Our three friends from the same school had roll 
                   numbers as well. I had a roll in class six 6. There were more friends here. I used to do a lot of mischief. There were 
                   some terrible sir. Those who hit a lot. There was something good, sir. There was some sleeping sir. Calling friends 
                   frogs was the funniest. Then I would wake up in the morning. I used to stay private in the morning. I would leave home
                   in the morning and come back in the afternoon. I took the JSC exam in 2013. That was too bad.Even though my result was
                   bad, the teachers told me to take science. But I will take science in advance. I then turned my attention back to my 
                   studies. In this way I studied class 9-10 very well. SSC exam results were good. I started living in a hostel from 
                   school life. There is a lot of fun in the hostel but the study is less than that. Some good sir, who really wants us 
                   to be ideal students. Not to mention their names Karim Sir, Nasir Uddin Sir, Shafiq Sir, Sattar Sir.                   
                </p>
                <h3>Juranpur Adarsha College</h3>
                <h5>2016-2018</h5>
                <p>
                   I got admitted in college in 2016. Being away from home, I had to study in a hostel. Stay away from this first home.
                   New environment new friends. At first it was difficult to adapt, but later it was fixed. Lots of stress studying. 
                   Lots of tution, with classes up to 2:30 pm. But staying in this first hostel is a different kind of fun. There are many 
                   competitors to study, many Unity. The college campus is beautiful to see much bigger. In the afternoon many people come 
                   to walk.The science department is better than the other departments. Teachers are so good they try to give their best.
                   It is possible to do something good if you want to be honest. The day started from college. Different arrangements on
                   different days. Partying together, going for walks, hanging out, playing is another kind of pleasure. Monir Sir was 
                   a funny sir. Even if you forget all the sirs of your career, it is not possible to forget Monir sirs. 
                   Preparation for the final exam was good but the exam was not good. The results were not so commendable. 
                   But college life was the best. With some friends, teachers, events will be remembered forever.                  
                </p>
                <h3>Faridpur Engineering College</h3>
                <h5>2019-</h5>
                <p>
                    Faridpur Engineering College my hole life best place.Dhaka University admission exam promotted that's why i am admitted in this capuse.
                    He first came to the campus on 5 February 2019. As the evening wore on, Farhan Bhai saw me and brought me to Rome. Where
                    there were many like me. This room is called the public room, where many people spend their days together. I spent three 
                    months in this public room, with great pleasure. He didn't let me stay for a while, I had to go out. I woke up in a mess, 
                    a familiar friend from the same department.Sajjad, Kibria is very friendly so I quickly became a mixer. But I didn't like the mess.
                    Because, a lot of friends on campus, I used to play again. So I spent most of my time on campus. Became a very good relationship 
                    with everyone. I participated in almost all sports, so everyone knew me. Campus became more and more dear to me. After going like
                    this for a year, I got a seat. That was also the recommendation of the elder brother.
